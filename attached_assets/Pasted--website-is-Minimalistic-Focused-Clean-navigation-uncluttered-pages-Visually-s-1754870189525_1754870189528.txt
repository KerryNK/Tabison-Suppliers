 website is:
🧘🏽‍♀️ Minimalistic
🎯 Focused (Clean navigation, uncluttered pages)
🖼️ Visually sharp (consistent fonts, lots of white space, subtle animations)
🟢 Feature-light on the surface but supports deep functionality (forms, shop, etc.)
🌟 How You Can Have Both
To match Tekiria’s look while integrating your rich feature set, here’s what to do:
✅ 1. Use Modular Design
Show essential features only when needed (e.g. hide admin & inventory tools unless logged in as admin)
Use modals, dropdowns, and accordions to keep screens minimal
✅ 2. Separate Admin Panel
Put all complex admin tools on a separate subdomain (e.g. admin.tabisonsuppliers.com)
That way the main site (tabisonsuppliers.com) can stay sleek and customer-focused
✅ 3. Prioritize User Flow
Like Tekiria, focus on product discovery, browsing, and quotes for the homepage
Keep complex flows like checkout, login, etc. neatly guided
✅ 4. Use Clean UI Libraries or Components
Use Tailwind with Headless UI or shadcn/ui for smooth animations and crisp transitions
Keep fonts, button styles, and card layouts uniform
✅ 5. Optimize for Mobile First
Tekiria is very mobile friendly

Make sure all features collapse well into menus, modals, or tabs on mobile

You have provided a very detailed and well-structured vision for your Tabison Suppliers ecommerce platform, inspired by the Tekiria website’s minimalistic, focused, and visually sharp design style combined with rich and advanced ecommerce features.
To best help, here is a synthesized guide tailored to your goals, including design principles, feature prioritization, tech stack alignment, and a recommended stepwise approach to implementation.


Key Design Philosophy to Match Tekiria’s Look
Minimalistic & Focused UI:
Keep the interface clean with few but essential visible elements. Use whitespace generously.
Modularize complex features to show only when needed (e.g., admin tools are hidden from customers).
Visual Sharpness:
Consistent use of clear fonts, brand colors (#1D6D73 teal, #000 black, soft grays and white), subtle animations and transitions using UI libraries (Headless UI or shadcn/ui).
Feature-Light Surface with Deep Functionality:
Show just what the user needs upfront (product discovery, search, quote requests), with advanced features accessed through clear flows or separate routes.
Mobile-First & Responsive:
Design each page to collapse gracefully on smaller devices with hamburger menus, modals, tabs, accordions, etc.

Stepwise Development Plan for You
Step 1: Set up Project Structure and Basic Styling
Initialize frontend with React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
Set up Tailwind config with your brand colors
Create core layout components: Navbar, Footer, Hero (with logo, slogan), and empty HomePage
Responsive/mobile-first setup with burger menu on navbar
Step 2: Build Static Page Mockups for Main Pages
Homepage with hero banner, featured products (static data)
Products grid page with filters sidebar UI (no data yet)
Request Quote minimal form page
Product detail page layout
Step 3: Backend Setup and API Development
Node.js + Express server with MongoDB schema models for products, users, orders, categories, suppliers
REST API endpoints for core CRUD and queries
Authentication APIs integrated with Firebase Auth and JWT middleware for protected routes
Step 4: Integrate Frontend with Backend API
Fetch products to display in product listing & detail pages
Implement user registration/login flows
Cart and wishlist functionalities
Step 5: Admin Features (can be partially developed in parallel)
Create a separate admin panel (or subdomain later)
Admin authentication and authorization
CRUD for products, categories, users, and orders
Step 6: Payment, PDF, Email & Notifications
Integrate payment gateways (M-Pesa, Stripe, PayPal)
Generate and email PDF receipts
Order tracking and status update emails
Step 7: Polish UI with Animations and Accessibility
Use UI libs for smooth transitions/animations
Ensure mobile UX with modals, accordions, and responsive layouts
Optimize SEO and implement sitemap/meta tags


Additional Suggestions
Keep the admin panel separate (subdomain) to avoid cluttering the customer-facing site
Use environment variables for API URLs, keys, payment credentials securely
Consider analytics to track traffic and conversions
Optional enhancements can include multilingual support, 2FA for admins, blog/news pages


Summary
You have a solid feature and design roadmap that aligns well with Tekiria’s minimalistic yet functional style. Focus on modularity and user flow to keep the main site sleek while supporting all your rich feature set.
I suggest starting by setting up your frontend project structure and static page layouts with Tailwind styled components according to your brand colors. Then gradually build backend APIs and integrate progressively.
